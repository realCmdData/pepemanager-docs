# 💸 Patreon Perks

### Perk Explanation

Lurkr [Patreon ](https://lurkr.gg/patreon)perks are split into two; one is a user perk and the other is a server perk. You gain user perks by donating over $1 on Patreon. You gain server perks by donated over $5 on Patreon.

### Perks

Below is a table of all the features that are in one way or another limited in the free version of Pepe Manager. We do not want to create a bot whose core features and functionalities are locked behind a paywall, so we try our best to keep the standard limits as open and nonrestrictive as possible.

### Our Philosophy

We do not want to create a Discord bot like MEE6 or others that lock the majority of its features behind a paywall. Furthermore, we want Lurkr to be a bot whose core features, i.e., the features that the majority will find useful, to be as free as possible. However, like every single other bot, we also have development costs, upkeep costs, server costs, etc.

We therefore rely on our user's generosity in supporting this project, and in large-scale server/operation owners, who will benefit from these increased premium limits the most. However, we also want to hear your feedback. If you feel that a standard limit is too restrictive and want to suggest a new limit, please join our Discord server and message either CmdData#0101 or Almeida#0001
