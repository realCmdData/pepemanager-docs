# Random Emoji

### Description

This command can be used to find a random emoji in your server for the sheer fun of it. Perhaps play a game of "First to find the special emojis wins something". ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

It can only select a random emoji from your current server and not from all servers that Pepe Manager is in. It will also not select an emoji from the default Discord emojis.
