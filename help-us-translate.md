# Help Us Translate!

### Translate!

We need **your** help to translate the documentation! As of writing this we currently only have the German language fully translated, but if you want to help us translate the documentation into your native language, just follow these steps:

### 1. Sign In/Up to GitHub

Follow [this link](https://github.com/realCmdData/pepemanager-docs) to the public GitHub Repository. If you do not have a GitHub account, please make one before proceeding.

### 2. Choose a Language to Translate

Click on the following buttons and select a language. If you don't see your native language in the drop-down menu, please DM CmdData!

### 3. Start Translating

We recommend using machine translation tools such as **DeepL** or **Google Translate** to speed up the translation process, and all you have to do is double-check if the machine translation is correct and if it provides a good context. The following folders/files are what needs to be translated in order for each language to be adopted into the documentation.

### 4. Formatting and What Not to Translate

In the following image, the circled red text is what you **do not** need to translate. It is formatting code, and if it's changed in any way it will change how the page will look on the documentation. [This guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) tells you all you need to know about Markdown.
