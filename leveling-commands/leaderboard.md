# Leaderboard

### Description

This command can be used to view the leveling leaderboard for the server that you're in. The leaderboard will only show up if the server has leveling enabled and if there are users who have already earned XP in the appropriate channels. 

The embedded message will add ◀ and ▶ buttons, which when pressed by the command author allows you to turn to the next leaderboard page. Your reaction will be removed after the new page is displayed, allowing you to react again. A total of 10 users can be listed on the same page, and are shown what level they are and how much XP they have gained.

Free servers have access to a 100 user leaderboard \(10 Pages\) while premium servers have access to a 200 user leaderboard \(20 Pages\). Learn more about premium servers [here](../information/patreon-perks.md).
