# Patrons

### Description

This command can be used to show the top 10 Patrons. The list is ordered by the amount of support the users give us. If you are a Patron and you cannot see yourself on this list, chances are your pledge wasn't high enough to make it into the top 10 or you have not yet linked your Patreon and Discord account.
