# ðŸ”— Setting a Leaderboard Vanity URL

### Why Would You Need This?

Vanity URL's, like the name already implies, makes you stand out and away from the long string of numbers that normally represent your server. Give your leaderboard it's own unique flair by giving it the same name as your server, or an acronym to let your members find the leaderboard easier!

## Guide

### Choosing a Good Vanity

A lot of people might not know what to put as their vanity, so here are some key tips in order to help you pick the vanity that's right for you!

* **If your server has a short name (Up to 10-15 Characters)** - You can just get away with using your server name as the vanity! It's short enough to be memorable, and it reflects your server perfectly!
* **If your server has multiple words** - You can take the first letter of each word and create an acronym for your server! For example: Game Dev League = GDL
* **If your server name has a keyword** - You can just take that keyboard and use it! For example: Splitgate - Season 0 = Splitgate

**Vanity's are entirely unique!**

If you set a vanity, no other server can use it and vice-versa.

Therefore, if another server has taken the vanity you were aiming for, you can simply try a different technique to choosing a good vanity!
