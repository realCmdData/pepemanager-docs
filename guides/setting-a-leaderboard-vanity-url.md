# Setting a Leaderboard Vanity URL

### Why Would You Need This?

Using the clunky and unsightly pepemanager.com leaderboard link works, sure. But it is quite unsightly, long and it's not personalized at all! Now, for free, you can set your own special vanity URL that will promise to be short and to the point, and of course easily rememberable! Just for this task we've purchased the short and sweet [pepe.chat](https://pepe.chat) domain, and by setting a vanity URL you will get your very own pepe.chat link, such as [pepe.chat/pepe](https://pepe.chat/pepe)! The link will then automatically redirect to your server's leaderboard!

### Choosing a Good Vanity

A lot of people might not know what to put as their vanity, so here are some key tips in order to help you pick the vanity that's right for you!

* **If your server has a short name (Up to 10-15 Characters)** - You can just get away with using your server name as the vanity! It's short enough to be memorable, and it reflects your server perfectly!
* **If your server has multiple words** - You can take the first letter of each word and create an acronym for your server! For example: Game Dev League = GDL
* **If your server name has a keyword** - You can just take that keyboard and use it! For example: Splitgate - Season 0 = Splitgate

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Vanity's are entirely unique!** If you set a vanity, no other server can use it and vice-versa.\
Therefore, if another server has taken the vanity you were aiming for, you can simply try a different technique to choosing a good vanity!
{% endhint %}

### Setting your Vanity

All you have to do to set your vanity URL is to type the command shown below or visit your server dashboard and do it there! Either way within a few moments the vanity should be up and running and you can start linking it to people!

```
p!config set vanity <Vanity>
```

### Deleting your Vanity

To delete your vanity (In order to set it to something else for example) all you have to do is type the command shown below, or as before visit your server dashboard!
