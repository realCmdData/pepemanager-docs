# On Join Roles (With Timeout)

### Why Would You Need This?

Automatically adding roles to new members can serve many useful purposes, from giving new members a cool colour in your chat, to giving out permission roles that can be taken away if needed, or for adding ping roles for announcements.\
However, if you have a Discord verification level enabled that makes users who don't surpass the verification level needed, automatically adding a role when someone joins will bypass this verification filter! Pepe Manager allows you to set a timer from the moment a user joins to when they will receive the role, so the verification system is not bypassed!

## Guide

### Evaluating your Verification Level

In order for this guide to be most effective, you should go into your server settings, go to the Moderation tab, and double-check which verification level you have selected.

The verification level of **Medium** has a timeout of 5 minutes, whereas the **High** and **Highest** settings have a timeout of 10 minutes.

### Setting your On Join Roles

You can now add your On Join Roles to Pepe Manager. In the current version, it is not possible to assign different roles to different timeouts, they will all be assigned at the same time.\
The free version of the bot allows you to assign up to 5 On Join Roles at the same time, whereas the premium allows you to assign up to 25 On Join Roles. [Click here to learn more](../information/patreon-perks.md).

### Setting your Timeout

You can now specify how long the bot should wait before assigning the roles after a user joins. This is not limited to either 5 minutes or 10 minutes, you can set the timeout to as little as 1 minute or as high as 30 minutes.

A modal-box will then appear, in which you can then enter the time interval you want to assign.
