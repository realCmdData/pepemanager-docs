# Blacklisting Members from using Commands

### Why Would You Need This?

Moderating a server is already harder than it needs to be. And keeping all of the bots confined to one or multiple channels to stop users from using and/or abusing them in general channels is hard as well. The easiest way to keep everything where it's supposed to be is with blacklisting. Only allow Pepe Manager to respond to commands in designated areas.
